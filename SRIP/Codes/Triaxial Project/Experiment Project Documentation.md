**Experiment Project Documentation**

**Introduction**

This  document captures the technical details related to the experiment development.

**Project**

**Domain Name :** Computer Science &amp; Engineering

**Lab Name :**  Soil Mechanics

**Experiment Name :** Triaxial Test

A triaxial test is a common method to measure the mechanical properties of many deformable solids, especially soil and rock, and other granular materials or powders.

Building the simulator for this  is what the project is about.

This document helps to understand how the simulator has been built using primarily javascript.



**Purpose of the project**

The purpose of the project is to convert the **Triaxial Test** experiment simulation from **Flash Based** to **Javascript**.

| 1. | Procedure | This document captures the instructions to run the simulations |
| 2. | Test Cases | This document captures the functional test cases of the experiment simulation |
| 3. | Code Documentation | This document captures the  details related to code |





**Process Followed to convert the experiment**

1. Understand the assigned experiment Java simulation
2. Understanding the experiment concept
3. Re-implement the same in javascript

**Value Added by our Project**

1. It would be beneficial for engineering students
2. Highly beneficial for tier 2 and tier 3 college students who can use this to learn and understand how to build simulations with javascript.

**Risks and Challenges**

As I had not much idea about javascript learning and building everything from scratch was a challenge as well as fun at the same time.
